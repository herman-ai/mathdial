I started by figuring out that one dozen is equal to 12, so two dozens is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 pens.

I started by figuring out how many people each serving would feed. I knew that the 8 piece fried chicken bucket and 2 sides feed 6 people, so I divided 6 by 8 to get 0.75 people per serving.

I'm happy to explain my thought process on how we solved this problem together.\\n\\nFirst, let's understand what we're dealing with here. We know that an 8-piece fried chicken bucket plus 2 sides can serve 6 people. This means if someone serves just one item (either the chicken or the sides), it serves 6/8 = 0.75 people because there are 8 items in total.\\n\\nNow, if we want to feed 36 people, using our ratio from earlier, we divide the number of people by the number served per set:\\n\\n\\[ \\frac{36}{0.75} = 48 \\]\\n\\nSo, we need 48 servings to feed 36 people. Since each serving provides enough for 8 pieces (one chicken and two sides), we calculate the number of sets required:\\n\\n\\[ \\frac{48}{8} = 6 \\]\\n\\nMonty needs to get 6 sets of the bucket and sides, which is equivalent to buying 6 * $12 = $72 worth of buckets and sides combined.\\n\\nThis method allows us to break down the calculation into smaller parts\u2014first determining how many servings are needed based on the total number of people to feed,<EOM>Teacher: Thank you for explaining your approach. Let's clarify why your initial steps were not quite right and then move forward with the correct method.\\n\\n### Initial Mistakes:\\n1. **Incorrect Calculation of Serving Size**: You calculated the serving size as \\( \\frac{36}{0.75} \\) instead of understanding that each set serves 6 people.\\n2. **Incorrect Application of Ratio**: While you correctly identified that you need 6 sets (since 36 divided by 6 equals 6), you didn't apply the cost accurately when calculating the total amount.\\n\\n### Correct Solution:\\n\\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\\n\\n1. **Determine Total Number of Sets Needed**:\\n   - Each set serves 6 people.\\n   - Monty has 36 people to feed.\\n   - To find out how many sets are needed, divide the total number of people by the number of people each set serves:\\n     \\[\\n     \\frac{36 \\text{ people}}{6 \\text{ people/set}} = 6 \\text{ sets}\\n     \\]\\n\\n2. **Calculate Cost Per Set**:\\n   - Each set costs $12.00.\\n   - Therefore, the total cost for 6 sets is:\\n     \\<EOM>Student: Apologies for any confusion; let\u2019s re-examine and correct these mistakes step by step:\\n\\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\\n   - An 8-piece fried chicken bucket plus 2 sides serves 6 people.\\n   - The goal is to feed 36 people.\\n\\n2. **Correcting the Servings per Set**:\\n   - From the information given, each set (which includes 8 pieces) serves 6 people.\\n   - To find out how many sets are needed to feed 36 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each set serves:\\n     \\[\\n     \\frac{36 \\text{ people}}{6 \\text{ people/set}} = 6 \\text{ sets}\\n     \\]\\n\\n3. **Calculating the Total Cost**:\\n   - Each set costs $12.00.\\n   - For 6 sets, the total cost is:\\n     \\[\\n     6 \\text{ sets} \\times \\$12.00/\\text{set} = \\$72.00\\n     \\]\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Monty should spend $72 to purchase the necessary sets of the bucket and sides to feed 36 people.<EOM>Teacher: That's absolutely correct! Let's go over the corrections step-by-step to ensure clarity:\\n\\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \\n   - An 8-piece fried chicken bucket and 2 sides together serve 6 people.\\n   - Monty needs to feed 36 people.\\n\\n2. **Correcting the Servings per Set**:\\n   - From the information given, each set (which contains 8 pieces) serves exactly 6 people.\\n   - To determine how many sets are needed to feed 36 people, divide the total number of people by the number of people each set serves:\\n     \\[\\n     \\frac{36 \\text{ people}}{6 \\text{ people/set}} = 6 \\text{ sets}\\n     \\]\\n\\n3. **Calculating the Total Cost**:\\n   - Each set costs $12.00.\\n   - For 6 sets, the total cost is:\\n     \\[\\n     6 \\text{ sets} \\times \\$12.00/\\text{set} = \\$72.00\\n     \\]\\n\\nSo, Monty needs to spend **$72** to buy enough chicken and sides to feed everyone one serving.
